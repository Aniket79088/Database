
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface for interacting with databases and efficiently managing, organizing, and retrieving data. The primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide a systematic and structured way to store, manage, and retrieve information in a database.

Data Organization:

 Without a DBMS, data might be stored in flat files or spreadsheets, making it difficult to organize and retrieve information in a structured manner.

Data Redundancy:

 In a non-database environment, data redundancy (duplicated data) is common, leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies.

Concurrency Control:

 In a multi-user environment, simultaneous access to data can lead to conflicts and data inconsistencies.

Scalability:

 As data grows, managing it in a non-scalable environment becomes complex and inefficient.

Data Recovery and Backup:

 Without proper backup and recovery mechanisms, data loss due to hardware failures, software errors, or human mistakes can be catastrophic.
