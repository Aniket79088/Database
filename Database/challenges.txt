Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

 Files often led to data redundancy and inconsistency because the same data could be stored in multiple files, leading to duplication and potential inconsistencies.

Data Isolation:

  In file-based systems, data is often isolated in separate files, making it challenging to access and integrate information stored in different files.

Data Dependence:

  File-based systems are highly dependent on the programs that access them. Changes to the structure of files may require modifications to multiple programs, leading to maintenance s.

Limited Security and Access Control:

  File-based systems often lack robust security mechanisms, making it challenging to control access to sensitive data.

Concurrency Control:

  Concurrent access to files by multiple users can lead to data corruption and inconsistency.
