The Three Schema Architecture, also known as the ANSI/SPARC architecture, is a widely accepted framework for database design and management. It divides the database system into three abstraction layers, each serving a specific purpose. The three schema architecture consists of the following layers:

1. External Schema (View Level):
   - Purpose: This layer deals with how data is presented to and interacts with end-users or applications. It focuses on providing a logical and user-friendly view of the data.
   - Components:
     - Views: Represent subsets of the data for specific user groups or applications.
     - External schemas: Define the logical structure and organization of data as seen by specific user groups.
   - Advantages:
     - Data Independence: Changes to the external schema (e.g., adding or modifying views) do not affect the conceptual or internal schema, providing a level of data independence.
     - Customization: Different user groups or applications can have tailored views of the data, optimizing data access and presentation.

2. Conceptual Schema (Logical Level):
   - Purpose: This layer defines the overall logical structure of the entire database. It abstracts away specific details of how data is stored or accessed.
   - Components:
     - Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD): Represents entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.
     - Conceptual schema: Describes the logical structure of the entire database.
   - Advantages:
     - Data Independence: Changes in the storage or organization of data (internal schema) do not impact the conceptual or external schema, ensuring a high degree of data independence.
     - Uniform Representation: Ensures a consistent and standardized representation of the data model, facilitating communication among stakeholders.

3. Internal Schema (Storage Level):
   - Purpose: This layer focuses on how data is physically stored, indexed, and managed within the database. It addresses efficiency, storage structures, and access mechanisms.
   - Components:
     - Storage structures: Define how data is stored on the storage media (e.g., tables, indexes).
     - Internal schema: Describes the physical storage and access mechanisms for the entire database.
   - Advantages:
     - Performance Optimization: Allows for optimization of data storage structures and access methods, enhancing database performance.
     - Data Security: Enforces access controls and security measures at the storage level to protect sensitive information.
     - Database Tuning: Provides flexibility for database administrators to fine-tune the storage and retrieval processes for optimal performance.

Advantages of Three Schema Architecture:

1. Data Independence:
   - Changes to one schema (external, conceptual, or internal) do not affect the other schemas. This separation provides a high degree of data independence, allowing modifications at one level without impacting others.

2. Flexibility and Customization:
   - Different user groups or applications can have customized views of the data (external schema), promoting flexibility and adaptability to diverse requirements.

3. Standardization:
   - The conceptual schema enforces a standardized and consistent representation of the database structure, facilitating communication among stakeholders involved in the database design process.

4. Security and Performance Optimization:
   - The internal schema allows for the implementation of security measures and performance optimizations at the storage level, ensuring data security and efficient data retrieval.

5. Enhanced Maintenance:
   - Changes or updates to the database can be localized to specific schemas, making maintenance and evolution of the database system more manageable.
