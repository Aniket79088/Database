 A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data. It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files.

Some examples of how databases are used include storing customer information in a customer relationship management (CRM) system, storing financial transactions in an accounting system, storing inventory and orders in an e-commerce system, storing patient records in a healthcare system, and storing student records in an educational institution.
